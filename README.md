# Face-mask-detection-on-Raspberry-Pi

## Problem Statement 

Design a methodology to detect whether a person is masked or not.

## Objectives
* Develop an algorithm to perform mask detection.
* Detect masks for multiple people.
* Signal whether mask found or not found.

## Motivation
* The best prevention at times of a pandemic is to utilize facial coverings. Wearing masks is one such way to reduce the transmission of infections from breathing, speaking, coughing, sneezing, transmission.  
* Monitoring large groups of people in public areas who comply with rules set by the governments has become a challenge in the past two years. With machine learning algorithms, building a face mask detection system would assist the automation task and help mitigate the risk. 

## Why 
* *Corporate sector*: Face mask detection can be used to maintain a safe environment for everyone. The mask detection system can send alerts or reminders to those not complying.
* *Airports*: The Face Mask Detection System can be used at airports to detect travelers without masks. Face mask detector can be very effectively used at airports mainly for entrance flow management and monitoring.
* *Public Transport*: In the view of pandemic, public transport will be needing to use a software to automate the checking process with very little resources needed and with efficiency.
